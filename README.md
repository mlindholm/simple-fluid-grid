# Simple fluid grid

A simple and fluid 12 column grid with 24px gutters. Supports nested columns, center columns and offsets (up to three by default). Containing element defines the max-width and is not defined by default, making it more flexible.

The grid has one break point at 767px, giving you two sizes: mobile and desktop. In the mobile vesion all columns are the same width.

Based on [Gridpak](http://gridpak.com) and inspired by Chris Coyiers article [Donâ€™t Overthink It Grids](http://css-tricks.com/dont-overthink-it-grids/).

# Simple fluid grid

A simple and fluid grid, based on [Gridpak](http://gridpak.com) and inspired by Chris Coyiers article [Donâ€™t Overthink It Grids](http://css-tricks.com/dont-overthink-it-grids/).

Supports nested columns, center columns and offsets (up to three columns). Containing element defines the max-width and is not defined by default, making it more flexible depending on the usage. Uses box-sizing: border-box property, works with IE6/7 using [boxsizing polyfill](https://github.com/Schepp/box-sizing-polyfill).

Two sizes: desktop/tablet (over 640px) and moble (under 640px). In the mobile vesion all columns are the same width.

Made for my personal use, feel free to use.
